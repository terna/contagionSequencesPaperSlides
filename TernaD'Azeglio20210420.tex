\section{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Objectives of the model}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
We propose an agent-based model to simulate the Covid-19 epidemic diffusion, with Susceptible, Infected, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and Recovered people: hence the name S.I.s.a.R. The scheme comes from S.I.R. models, with (i) infected agents categorized as symptomatic and asymptomatic and (ii) the places of contagion specified in a detailed way, thanks to agent-based modeling capabilities. 

 \item
The infection transmission is related to three factors: the infected person's characteristics and those of the susceptible one, plus those of the space in which a contact occurs.

 \item
The model includes the structural data of Piedmont, but it can be readily calibrated for other areas. The model manages a realistic calendar (e.g., national or local government decisions), via a script interpreter.  


 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Tool and links}

  \begin{itemize}

\item We use NetLogo, at \url{https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/}.

\section{Contagions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Contagion representation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Contagion representation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
The model allows analyzing the sequences of contagions in simulated epidemics, reporting the places where the contagion occur. 
  \item
We represent each infected agent as a horizontal segment (from the starting date to the final date of the infection) with vertical connections to other agents if they receive the disease.

We represent the new infected agents via further segments at an upper level. 

  \item
With colors, line thickness, and styles, we display multiple information. 

  \item
This enables understanding at a glance how an epidemic episode is developing. In this way, it is easier to reason about countermeasures and, thus, to develop intervention policies.

  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation batches}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Simulation batches}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item

We explore systematically the introduction of factual, counterfactual, and prospective interventions to control the spread of the contagions. 

  \item
Each simulation run---whose length corresponds to the disappearance of symptomatic or asymptomatic contagion cases---is a datum in a wide scenario of variability in time and effects.   
  
  \item
We need to represent compactly the results  emerging from batches of simulation repetitions, to compare the  consequences of the basic assumptions adopted for each specific batch.

 \item
Besides summarizing the results with the usual statistical indicators, we adopt the technique of the heat-maps.

\item
Each heat-map reports the duration of each simulated epidemic in the $x$ axis and the number of the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and deceased agents in the $y$ axis. The $z$ axis is represented by the colors, as in the logarithmic scale on the right of each picture. 

\item
In our batches we have 10,000 runs.

\end{itemize}

\item Following the Civil Protection Department web site \url{http://www.protezionecivile.it/web/guest/department}, we find the
 repository \url{https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19}.
 
 \item In the first wave we had uniquely data about symptomatic infected people, but from October 2021 data are mixed.
 
 \item In the above \emph{git}  repository, in October and November we had ``Positive cases emerged from clinical activity'', unfortunately now reported as ``No longer populated'' (from the end of November, my observation) and ``Positive cases emerging from surveys and tests, planned at national or regional level'', again ``No longer populated'' (from the end of November, my observation).
 
 \item Using those two series, it was possible to estimate a subdivision between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, which is no longer possible.

\item A quite impressive analysis  in Nature, Feb. 16, 2021, 
\emph{The coronavirus is here to stay---here's what that means}

\medskip

\url{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2}

\medskip

\emph{A Nature survey shows many scientists expect the virus that causes COVID-19 to become endemic, but it could pose less danger over time}.

\medskip

\item
If Nature is right, a possible long-term strategy is to stop all fragile people for a given period when $R_t$ starts increasing (also with fragile workers in sick leave, if unable to work remotely).

\medskip

With social benefits, e.g., schooling, and economic benefits, if activities do not stop

\medskip

\item Besides, mainly for the fragile people, adopt prevention and vaccinations.

\medskip

\item A note: the same strategy would also have been surprisingly efficient now, for the second wave.

\section{Planning vaccination campaigns}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Planning a vaccination campaign using GAs (with non-pharmaceutical containment measures in action)}

\begin{itemize}

\item An introduction to genetic algorithms (GAs) is at \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm}, with the related Holland's schema theorem at 
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland's_schema_theorem}.

\bigskip

\item Exploring vaccination sequences, using \emph{genetic algorithms}. A detailed note, frequently updated, is at \url{https://terna.to.it/simul/GAresultPresentation.pdf}.

\bigskip

\item We compare the effect of choosing the vaccination quotas via GAs with two predetermined strategies, considering three hypotheses (vaccinated people: still spread the contagion; do not spread the contagion; do it in the 50\% of the case); we show here only the first case results.

\bigskip

\item Key dates: 
\begin{itemize}
\item in the internal calendar of the model, day 373 is Feb. \nth{12}, 2021, which is effectively the starting point of the vaccinations in the region; 

\item the day of the effectiveness of the initial vaccinations, 40 days later, is day 413 (Mar. \nth{22}, 2021).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Vaccination groups}

We take into consideration seven groups in order of decreasing fragility but also considering the exposure to contagion:

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\emph{g1}]
	extra fragile people with three components;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item due to intrinsic characteristics: people in nursing homes;
		\item due to risk exposure:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item nursing homes operators;
			\item healthcare operators;
 		\end{itemize} 
 	\end{itemize}  
\item [\emph{g2}]
	teachers;
\item [\emph{g3}]
	workers with medical fragility;
\item [\emph{g4}]
	regular workers;
\item [\emph{g5}]
	fragile people without special characteristics;
\item [\emph{g6}]
	regular people, not young, not worker, and not teacher;
\item [\emph{g7}]
	young people excluding special activity cases (a limited number in \emph{g1}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Some final considerations}

\begin{itemize}

\item
The importance of High Performance Computing.

\bigskip

\item The S.I.s.a.R. model is a tool for comparative analyses, not for forecasting (the enormous standard deviation values are intrinsic to the problem).


\item The model is highly parametric and more it will be.

\item New crisis calling for immediate simulation could take a substantial advantage from the parametric structure of the model.
